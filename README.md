DynamicForm Web Part
This web part allows you to dynamically generate forms based on any SharePoint list. By selecting a SharePoint list from a dropdown, the web part automatically creates a form that reflects the list's columns and fields. Users can then fill out and submit the form, which directly integrates with the selected SharePoint list, ensuring that all input data is stored seamlessly.

The web part leverages the DynamicForm component from @pnp/spfx-controls-react, making it highly flexible and easy to use. It's ideal for scenarios where you need to quickly create and deploy forms without having to manually design them.
